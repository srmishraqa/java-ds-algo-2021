collection is a single entity which represents a group of Object

Collection Framework : It defines classes and interfaces which can be used to
represent a group of Object

Array Does not belong to collections Framework

Drawbacks of Array:
1. We can store Homogenous data (same type of data) -> This can be overcame by creating object array
2. Array will always have a limited fixed size -> while defining an array we need to declare the length
3. Not Growable in nature - size can't be increased or decreased during run time
4. While Implementing array java has not used any underlying data structure, there is no ready-made methods
 (like there is no in-built sorting method)

Collections Framework:
Advantages:
1. No Fixed size (growable in nature)
2. Collections can hold Homogenous data as well as heterogenous data
3. in-built ready made methods are available as it has an underlying data structure
